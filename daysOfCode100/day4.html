        <h4>Day 3- 6/24/2020</h4>
        <div>
            <p>The past few weeks I've been reviewing my skills and trying to get job ready. Today I read from
                <em>Ultralearning</em> and I worked on the
                into to SQL for Data Science on EdX, which I have until July 12th to finish working on. The SQL course
                is cool because it has students make a
                IBM cloud D2 instance using a free account, which we'll add a data set to in order to practice our SQL
                skills.
            </p>
            <p>The part of <em>Ultralearning</em> I read today made these points:
                <ul>
                    <li>Experiment with your learning: pick something and stay focused on it exclusively for a length of
                        time </li>
                    <li>Periodically review if you're on the right track or not and reassess goals</li>
                    <li>Beginners learn all at the same level, nothing. </li>
                    <li>As learning progresses, skillsets diverge and more options exist, leading to difficulty picking
                        a choice</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Day 2- 5/31/2020</h4>
        <div>
            <p>
                Today, I mostly relaxed and tried to create a realistic guide for my month of June,
                telling me what to focus on for improvement. I read a lot from Cal Newport's tips for
                <em>Straight A Students (1)</em>, along with reading some of <em>Ultralearning (2)</em>.
                <br><br>
                Some tips from those readings:
                <ul>
                    <li>Prioritize assignments instead of reading it all (1)</li>
                    <li>For non-technical classes, focus on the overall picture using question/evidence/conclusion (1)
                    </li>
                    <li>For technical classes, write down examples and solutions, but not necessarily every step in
                        between (1)</li>
                    <li>Drill particular lessons that you find most difficult, before bringing them back into the
                        project context of whatever you're working on (2)</li>
                    <li>The best type of reviewing is free recall without looking at notes, to see how much you remember
                        (2)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <h4>Day 1- 5/30/2020</h4>
        <div>
            <p>This week I've been watching a conference called Empower to Connect as part of my
                church's training for those who volunteer with kids. I love volunteering with kids
                and have been since June of 2018, so this training was a great supplement to my hands-on
                experience.
            </p>
            <p>This training discussed TBRI (Trust-Based Relational Intervention), and how we can help
                kids who come from difficult circumstances. Here are some of the lessons I learned from the conference:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reassure the child you love them no matter what and aren't going to leave</li>
                    <li>When dealing with difficult behavior, make sure you distinguish that you're saying no to the
                        behavior rather than the child</li>
                    <li>Focus on seeing the need behind the acting out behavior-- often this is because they're in
                        survival mode</li>
                    <li>We (adults) need to be the role models and teach kids more acceptable behavior to replace their
                        coping strategies</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
