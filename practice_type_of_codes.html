        <h1 align="center">HTML Tags and Tips</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>H heading tags range from h1-h6 (h1 is largest, h6 is smallest)
            </li>
            <li>Img tags need an src="" and are self-closing, an alt attribute must be set for accessibility</li>
            <li>Video tags are not self-closing, the text in the middle is displayed if the
                video cannot render, you can specify the src="" of the video, you can adjust the width and height
                and if you add the 'controls' attribute in the tag it will give you options to play and pause
            </li>
            <li>!DOCTYPE html at the top of page lets html know to render most recent html</li>
            <li>Anchor tags (a) can be set around any other tags, just add href="" and either the relative
                (./filename.html)
                or absolute file path of the link... and target="_blank" can be specified if you want it to open in a
                new
                tab
            </li>
            <li>Em tag is to <em>italicize</em> words, <strong>strong tag is to bold them</strong></li>
            <li>To link to other parts of same page, giv e the tag you want to link to an ID, then in the Anchor
                tag use href="#idHere"
            </li>
            <!--This practice page is helpful-->
            <li>Comments are added in html by typing ">!--" to open the comment (only with an opening bracket) and
                using "-->" to end the comment
            </li>
            <li>The difference between >b> tags and >strong> is b bolds and strong emphasizes important content</li>
            <li>Diff between >i> and >em> tags is i italicizes and em emphasizes important content</li>
            <li>Sub tag creates a <sub>subscript</sub>, sup tag creates a <sup>superscript</sup></li>
            <li>To create a strikethrough, you can use <del>del</del> or <strike>strike</strike></li>
            <li>The Ins tag will <ins>create an inserted look</ins></li>
            <li>There's also a <big>big tag</big> and a <small>small tag</small></li>
            <li>To add new lines or spacing, add the >br /> tag; to add a visible line to separate distinct content
                add an >hr /> tag
            </li>
            <li>Rather than typing <strong> document.querySelector() </strong> to select an element, you can
                type<strong>$()</strong>.
                This syntax is inspired by jQuery, but it's not actually jQuery. It's just an alias for
                document.querySelector()</li>
            <li>Using string literals (`Back ticks`) is known as string interpolation in JS</li>
            <li>The not operator (!) is also known as the Bang operator in JS</li>
            <li>The dot operator is used for methods/properties (string.length, Math.random()) in JS</li>
            <li>Short-circuit assignment is when you have an OR conditional and it only assigns the right side if the
                left
                side of the conditional is False or a Falsy value <br>(ex: let name = variableName || 'default'... name
                will
                be
                set to 'default' only if variableName is a Falsy value, either undefined or an empty string, otherwise
                name
                will be set to the value of variableName) in JS
            </li>
            <li>The ternary operator is a simplified way of writing if..else statements.. in them, the conditional
                statement
                is first then a question mark is used and two expressions follow which are separated by a semi-colon
                <br>(ex: conditionalStatement ? console.log("Prints If Conditional Is True") : console.log("Prints If
                False"); )</li>
            <li>Hoisting is the ability of JS to call functions in a program before they're actually defined, but it is
                not
                considered good practice. Good practice is functions defined at the top before usage.. Hoisting works
                because variable and function definitions stay in memory during the compile phase, so during execution
                they
                already exist... Only declarations are hoisted, not initialization if that is done separately so if you
                declare a variable without initializing it, it will be undefined until the part of the code that
                initializes
                it.. Also only declarations using var are hoisted, not those using let or const</li>
            <li>Defining a function does not actually execute the function, only calling the function does that.
                <br>ex: function hiya(){ console.log('Hiya!') } will not print to the console automatically. Only when
                you
                run hiya() will it run and print to the console.</li>
            <li>ES6 JS allows for default parameters to use a default value if called without that parameters
                <br>ex: function hiya(name = 'mystery person'){ console.log('Hiya ' + name)} will print to the console
                'Hiya
                nameOfPerson' or if called just
                hiya() without arguments, it will print 'Hiya mystery person'
            </li>
            <li>Functions being called within other functions to make code more readable are known as 'helper functions'
                since each function is carrying out a specific task.. Writing helper functions can break down large
                complex
                tasks into smaller pieces
            </li>
            <li>Functions can be anonymous, given no name to run just a code block with the function keyword OR
                Function expressions can be used in which a variable (usually declared with const) can be used to call
                the
                function in the future
            </li>
            <li>Pass by reference is when you pass in an array variable into a function, and it changes outside the
                function
                (mutates) because when you pass it into a function, you're actually passing a reference to where the
                variable memory is stored and then changing the variable memory
            </li>
            <li>If you try to go to an array index that is out of bound in JS, it will show you that element is
                undefined
            </li>
            <li>
                To make an object literal in JS, you assign a variable with curly braces
                <br>Ex: let objectVariable = {} creates an empty object
            </li>
            <li>
                Data in objects is stored in unordered key: value pairs.. The key is an identifier, which is a string
                but if
                there are no special characters in the key then the quotation marks can be omitted.. A property of an
                object
                is a key: value pair together
            </li>
            <li>Object properties are separated by commas</li>
            <li>If you try to access an Object property that does not exist, you will get back undefined</li>
            <li>To access an Object property that has numbers, spaces, special characters, or variables, required to use
                bracket
                notation instead of dot notation for properties</li>
            <li>An object declared with const can't be reassigned, but its properties can be mutated or re-assigned</li>
            <li>The delete operator will let you remove properties from objects and assignment operator can be used to
                add
                new properties or change properties
                <br>Ex: delete objectName.propertyName</li>
            <li>
                Object methods can be used as a key in an object with the value being an anonymous function to do the
                action
                and is just called by the key name, or the colon can be skipped along with the function keyword
                <br>Ex: objectName { methodName : function(){ console.log('This is what objectName.methodName() does') }
                }
                <br>Ex 2: objectName { methodName() { console.log('This is the alternate way of using methods in ES6') }
                }
            </li>
            <li>In JS, object methods do not automatically have access to the other properties of the method, must use
                'this' keyword for them to get access</li>
            <li>Avoid using arrow functions within objects using the 'this' keyword since the arrow syntax automatically
                bind an already defined this keyword to the function that is not calling the object, it uses a global
                object
                already defined and thus does not have the same properties as the object you're in</li>
            <li>JS does not come with privacy built in mind to tell people not to change variables/properties, so a
                practice
                many developers do is prepending variables that should be unmutable with an underscore at the beginning
                (let
                _dontTouch), which does not inherently keep people from changing them but does serve as a warning that
                it
                should be private</li>
            <li>Using a getter in JS is creating a method with the 'get' keyword, then inside the method block you can
                add
                conditionals to return various results based on inputs of a property. The 'getter property' cannot share
                the
                same name as an actual property within the object, and when you call the getter it looks like you're
                calling
                a property itself since you don't include parentheses but it gives a fully formatted response
                <br>Ex: let objectVar = { _dontTouch : 'How dare you!', get noTouchy(){ if(this._dontTouch === 'How dare
                you!'){ return 'No touchy!'} else{ return 'Someone touched the object properties!!!!!' } } }
                <br>And when called: objectVar.noTouchy will return 'No touchy!'
            </li>
            <li>A factory function lets us quickly make copies of objects with different parameters to make multiple
                instances of that object easily and quickly.
                <br>Ex: const objFactory = (parameterName1, parameterName2) => { return { parameterName1:
                parameterName1,
                parameterName2: parameterName2} }
                <br>Instance of objFactory: const newObj = objFactory(prop1, prop2);</li>
            <li>You can also use property value shorthand to save yourself writing
                <br>The above obj can be written: const objFactory = (parameterName1, parameterName2) => { return {
                parameterName1, parameterName2} }
            </li>
            <li>Destructured assignment allows you to use an object's key as a variable name and assign the variable
                from
                the object
                <br>Ex: const {residence} = vampire creates a variable residence and assigns it the property value of
                vampire.residence
            </li>
            <li>A predicate function is one that returns a boolean value</li>
            <li>"git init" is used to initialize a new git repository</li>
            <li>"git status" shows which branch you're on and which files git sees but is not tracking</li>
            <li>"git add [filename]" adds the file to the staging area, or use a "." instead of filename to add all
                files in
                the working directory</li>
            <li>"git diff [filename]" is used to show the difference in the file currently from what's stored in Git...
                The
                white text is what matches in Git, the red text is what used to be in the file, the green text is what
                was
                added to the file since the last commit
            </li>
            <li>'git commit -m "Commit message"' commits the changes in the staging area to the Git repository, should
                be in
                present tense, quotation marks, and under 50 characters</li>
            <li>The commit you are currently on is known as the HEAD commit, it's often the commit with the most recent
                changes</li>
            <li>The command "git show HEAD" will show your HEAD commit plus all file changes that were committed</li>
            <li>"git checkout HEAD [filename]" will reset the file in working directory back to last commit status</li>
            <li>"git reset HEAD [filename]" will unstage file changes that have been added to the staging area (by 'git
                add
                [filename]')</li>
            <li>"git reset commit_SHA" will let you go back to a certain commit (based on 1st 7 digits of the SHA that
                can
                be found by running 'git log')</li>
            <li>Semantic HTML includes >header>, >nav>, >main>, >footer>, >section>, >article>, and >aside> to help
                accessibility and clarity of the document, >section> is used for anything that can be grouped together
                whereas >article> is used for standalone articles/comments and >aside> is used for information that
                isn't
                directly related but extra information</li>
            <li>>Figure> tag can be used to surround an img tag to make it more semantically understandable to screen
                readers, and you can also use >figcaption> to surround any text that accompany the picture</li>
            <li>>Embed> is a tag that used to be used for images, videos, and audio, but now it's better to use those
                tags
                since Embed is used only for legacy support</li>
            <li>For audio and video tags, you can add a "controls" attribute so there will be a play button, fast
                forward
                and backwards.. other attributes are "autoplay" or "loop", source within those can be used as an
                attribute
                (src) or a standalone tag inside of (source)</li>
            <li>The progress tag contains attributes of Max, Min, and Value and will display a progress bar</li>
            <li>To add inline css, you add a "style" attribute to an HTML tag and within the quotes specify the style
                you want making sure to end with a semi-colon
                <br>Ex: >h1 style="color:blue; background-color: navy;"> would make that h1 have a blue color with navy
                background</li>
            <li>Another option to add CSS is to add a >style> tag to the head tag of the file and put your css there
            </li>
            </li>
            <li>But the preferred way of adding css is to link to a css file by adding a >link> tag with href attribute
                of the file path, type="text/css", rel="stylesheet"</li>
            <li>CSS can use tag names (p), class names (.class), or id names (#id) as selectors for styling</li>
            <li>In HTML, you can add multiple classes to the same tag by adding a space between classes</li>
            <li>Ids are the most specific CSS selector so they override other styles, then classes, and least specific
                are tag names</li>
            <li>You can chain CSS selectors by using tagName.className (ex: li.html would get all list elements with a
                class name of "html" and style them while ignoring other list elements and ignoring other non-list
                elements with a class of "html")</li>
            <li>In addition to chaining CSS selectors, you can also nest them (such as: aside ul{} would style only the
                unordered list that is nested within an aside element such as my Further Learning Links at the bottom of
                the page)</li>
            <li>To give two or more selectors the same styling, you can separate them with a comma</li>
        </ul>
