    <h2>Things I've learned</h2>
    <p>Hooks can be added only to top-level components or to other custom hooks... this.state can only be modified
        directly with class components (class App extends Component{ constructor(props){ super(props)} } ), any other
        changes to state must be done through useState which is an example of destructuring arrays (ex: const [count,
        setCount] = useState(0) where initial value of count is set to 0, and it's modified by setCount... ) </p>
