    <h1>Git Notes</h1>
    <h2>Git Branch Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>git branch -> shows all available branches, includes a * on the branch you are currently on
        </li>
        <li>git branch branchName -> creates a new branch with the name branchName
        </li>
        <li>git switch branchName -> switches the current branch to branchName
        </li>
        <li>git commit -a -m "Commit message here" -> is a way of adding all unstaged changes without having to type git
            add .
        </li>
        <li>git branch branchName -> creates a new branch with the name branchName based off of which branch the HEAD
            currently is on, so if it is run off of master it will include git log of master's previous commits to the
            point the branch was made, but if it were branched off of sideBranch then it would show sideBranch's commits
            up to the point it was branched off
        </li>
        <li>git checkout branchName -> the more historical way of switching the current branch to branchName, but git
            checkout can do far more than just changing branches which is why git switch was made to simplify usage
        </li>
        <li>git switch -c newBranchName -> the -c flag allows you to create a new branch and switch to it at the same
            time
        </li>
        <li>git checkout -b newBranchName -> adding the -b flag to git checkout makes the new branch and then switches
            to it
        </li>
        <li>if you try to git switch branchName while the current branch you are on has un-committed changes, it will
            give you a warning that new changes would be overwritten by checkout so they need to be committed or stashed
            before switching branches
        </li>
        <li>if you use git switch branchName and have a file that only exists on the currentBranch and is not being
            tracked (example.txt), git switch doesn't complain about overwriting instead the untracked file will come
            with you to the branchName that you switched to (example.txt will move from currentBranch to branchName with
            git status still reminding you example.txt is untracked)
        </li>
        <li>git branch -d branchName -> will delete the branch, but all changes must be merged in... cannot be called
            while currently on branchName
        </li>
        <li>git branch -D branchName -> will force delete the branchName regardless of if there are changes unmerged
            still.. cannot be called while currently on branchName
        </li>
        <li>git branch -m newBranchName -> if you are currently on branchToRename, run that command to rename the branch
            to newBranchName.. -m flag means move, which is what the renaming does by moving it to a branch with that
            new name
        </li>
        <li>HEAD -> is a reference (pointer) to the last commit on whichever branch is checked out.. so cat .git/HEAD
            shows ref: refs/heads/currentBranchName ... and if you check out that file path you will find the commit
            hash of the most recent commit
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- GIT MERGE NOTES -->
    <h2>Git Merge Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Git merges are based off of branches, not specific commits</li>
        <li>The git merge is always to the current HEAD branch
        </li>
        <li>Ex of a fast-forward merge: when on branchName and wanting to merge it to master, run "git switch master" to
            change the HEAD to master.. then run "git merge branchName" to merge the branch on to master so master
            "catches up" with the work that's been done on branchName
        </li>
        <li>git branch -v -> shows most recent commit on each of the branches that exist
        </li>
        <li>A fast-forward merge only happens when the branch to be merged was split off from the master branch but
            master hasn't moved forward any with more commits, so it just lets master catch up with the new commits on
            branchName
        </li>
        <li>When both master and branchName have new commits the other branch is not aware of, you merge the same way by
            switching to the master (git switch master) and then git merge branchName, but this time it creates a new
            commit for the merge that you'll need to leave a message for (or leave the default message). This only works
            if there are no merge conflicts.
        </li>
    </ul>
