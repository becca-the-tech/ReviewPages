    <h1>MongoDB notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>show dbs -> lists existing databases use certainDB -> changes the db in use to certainDB show collections ->
            shows existing collections within the DB
        </li>
        <li>db.collectionName.insertOne({name: valueName, age: valueAge}) -> inserts a single JS object into the
            collectionName with the key-value pairs listed in the parentheses
        </li>
        <li>db.collectionName.find() will show you which documents (the objects you've added to the collection) are part
            of that collectionName
        </li>
        <li>db.collectionName.insertMany([{ name: "object1", type: "whatever"}, {name: "object2", type: "something"]) ->
            takes in an array of objects and adds them as documents to the collectionName
        </li>
        <li>db.collectionName.insert() -> can take either a single object or an array of objects
        </li>
        <li>db.collectionName.find({name: "object1"}) -> find can take in an object just containing the key-value
            options you want to find, but it is case-sensitive
        </li>
        <li>db.collectionName.findOne({isBoolean: true}) -> will find the first matching result, returns the actual
            document whereas find() returns a cursor (which is like a pointer to the documents)
        </li>
        <li>db.collectionName.updateOne({name: "object1"}, {$set: { type: "what-whatever"} } ) -> the way of calling
            updateOne is the first object is what you are selecting based on, then the second object is {$set: {} } with
            the innermost brackets being which fields you are updating
        </li>
        <li>db.collectionName.updateOne({name: "object1"}, {$set: {type: "umm whatever"}, $currentDate: {lastChanged:
            true} }) -> will update the document that has a name of "object1" and change its type to "umm whatever", but
            it will also add a lastChanged field of type ISO-date set for the time when updated
        </li>
        <li>db.collectionName.deleteOne({filter: true}) -> will delete first document it finds that matches the selector
            condition
        </li>
        <li>db.collectionName.deleteMany({filter: true}) -> will delete all documents that match true for the filter
            condition, leaving it blank will delete everything from a collection
        </li>
    </ul>
