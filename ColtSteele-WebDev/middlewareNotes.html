    <h1>Middleware Notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>app.use() runs on every single incoming request, no matter the route if placed at the top</li>
        <li>middleware is any code that runs between the request and the response, functions that run during the
            request/response lifecycle
        </li>
        <li>res.send would stop the next function from being called, so next would not run EX: app.use((req, res, next)
            => {
            res.send("I get printed on every route"); next() })</li>
        <li>
            if next() isn't called, then it stops after app.use and does not continue on to the app.gets (or whatever is
            below
            it in the file) Ex: app.use((req, res, next) => { console.log("I print to console on each route"); next();
            })

        </li>
        <li>
            fake password verification middleware just to show theory of how to protect certain routes, clearly this
            isn't
            very secure<br>Ex: <br>const verifyPassword = (req, res, next) => { const { password } = req.query; if
            (password ===
            'something') { next(); } res.send("Sorry, you need the valid password!"); };<br><br>verifyPassword acts as a
            middleware
            since it runs before the (req, res) callback so it only sends "My secret is: " if verifyPassword sends
            next(),
            otherwise it gets stuck before the callback<br>Ex:<br> app.get("/secret", verifyPassword, (req, res) => {
            res.send("MY
            SECRET
            IS: Sometimes I like to read past my bed time."); });
        </li>
    </ul>
