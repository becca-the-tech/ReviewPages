    <h1>Error Handling with Express Notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>If you use an app.use((err, req, res, next) => { }) ---> it's an error handling middleware that is running,
            so
            if an error is thrown in any way then the code will run and if next() is not called within the code then
            there
            are no further actions to be done
        </li>
        <li>If you want the error passed from one middleware to the next error-handling middleware, you can run
            next(err) in
            your first middleware
        </li>
        <li>You can define your own error that extends the built-in error class by: class AppError extends Error {
            constructor(message, status) { super(); this.message = message; this.status = status }} module.exports =
            AppError; ----> and then import it on your Express js page, that way you have access to built-in errors but
            can
            also provide custom statuses or messages
        </li>
        <li>res.status(404).send(message) -> lets you set the status code to whatever you want and then res.send
            whatever
            message is.
        </li>
        <li>Mongoose does not throw errors when nothing is found, it just leaves them as undefined.. so to handle them
            in
            async functions, you can have async (req, res, next) and then pass the error into next within the function
            like
            next(new AppError("Product not found", 404));
        </li>
        <li>if you throw an error due to something not being found in Mongoose, be sure to return next(err) that way it
            won't keep trying to pass the info to EJS and still cause errors within the console even though they won't
            be
            displayed if res.send() was called by the middleware
        </li>
        <li>
            For async functions, wrap everything in try{} catch(e){next(e)} blocks and make sure to add async (req, res,
            next) within the route, but instead of returning the AppError you can just throw new AppError since it is
            being
            caught in the catch(e) block.
        </li>
        <li>function wrapAsync(fn){ return function(req, res, next){ fn(req, res, next).catch(e => next(e)); }}... can
            be
            used as a wrapped function for an async callback to avoid re-writing all those try and catch blocks to
            handle
            mongoose errors.
        </li>
        <li>
            the point of that wrapAsync(fn) is that it runs the function passed in and just makes sure it catches any
            errors
            that the function encountered
        </li>
        <li>you can also create custom error handlers based on err.name being detected and passed to the specific type
            of
            error handler (like for validationErr vs syntaxErr)</li>
    </ul>
