    <h1>Notes from Barbara Oakley's Course Learning How To Learn</h1>
    <h2>Diffuse versus Focused Mode</h2>
    <p>Diffuse mode is when you let your mind wander and it makes connections between different subjects. Focused mode
        is when you focus intensely on the things you are learning and to understand it.</p>

    <h2>Chunking</h2>
    <p>Chunking is learning in small sections and then using those parts to make connections to other lessons, linking
        lessons from diverse areas to see the big picture. It's easier to form chunks over time, using recall and spaced
        repetition, than trying to learn everything in one large study session. Recalling what you're learning about
        forces your brain to put things back into working memory and actively make connections which is why it's far
        more helpful than just highlighting or rereading material multiple times.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Procrastination</h2>
    <p>Procrastination is postponing studying/doing things you know you should for things that are more pleasurable
        temporarily, but in the long term it's like addiction giving you a false sense of happiness that hurts more in
        the long term.</p>
