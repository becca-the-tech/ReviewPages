            Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life,
            or whether that station will be held by anybody else,
            these pages must show. <br>
            To begin my life with the beginning of my life,
            I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday,
            at twelve o'clock at night. <br>
            It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.
