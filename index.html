            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://gentle-dawn-40473.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Learning Tracker</a>: This is my
                    favorite project right now. I created this fully by myself, it started as a way to practice flexbox
                    and keep track of my learning using a static page I updated. I've worked on it incrementally, from
                    updating the styling of the boxes to the nav bar at the top and making the article sections separate
                    parts. This latest update connects it with MongoDB using a Node.js backend so I can update it on my
                    computer or phone, and the newest feature is to track the amount of time all sections will take, and
                    update it to only include incomplete sections.</li>
                <li><a href="https://infinite-beyond-79502.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Book List Library
                        Organizer</a>: This is a project I made since I use library books and too often I go through
                    phases and get too many books at one time. It lets me input the title, number of pages, length of
                    audiobook, due date, and progress of the book in one place and it's saved to MongoDB so I don't have
                    to keep entering the info. It builds off a previous static version I made of this site that had been
                    built fully off of JS (but since it was static, info had to be re-enterred any time the page
                    refreshed). Most recent update includes favorited and archived books and adding notes to a book's
                    individual page. It uses Bootstrap, EJS, Express, and MongoDB. <strong>Please note: it looks best on
                        Google Chrome from a computer, it's mobile
                        functional with Bootstrap but some quirks need to be worked out.</strong></li>
                <li><a href="https://infinite-beyond-79502.herokuapp.com/quotes/random/6" target="_blank">Random Quotes
                        App</a>: This project was created because I discovered how to use the quotes from my 6+ year old
                    Kindle to populate a quotes database that stores the quote, the author, and which text it is from. I
                    used the File System (fs) module to read from the 'myClippings.txt' file and then parse through it
                    to get the relevant information I wanted and store each highlight as a quote object. Then I created
                    a page that displays all the quotes, but since there's over 4000, I can't read them one at a time
                    since scrolling takes forever so I miss quotes in the middle, so I created one page that will show
                    one random quote and also the option to use router parameters to specify the number of random quotes
                    in the browser to display. I've found 6 works well for me to see some content without too much at
                    one time so that's what I've linked here. Since my old hand-written quote journal could never keep
                    up with all the scientific studies from books I've read and it fell apart over time, this project
                    excited me since I love reviewing quotes from books that really made me view life differently.
                    Eventually I will add ways to favorite and delete quotes without having to go to an individual
                    quote's page. Disclaimer: Please keep in mind that since these quotes are spanning 6+ years of
                    books, my views may have changed and I may not necessarily agree with the quoted text, it just was
                    interesting enough to make me pause and highlight it, also context may be missing regarding the
                    quoted material if you haven't read the book it's from. </li>

                    connected to MongoDB for persistence, node.js backend. Followed a tutorial (Angela Yu's Udemy Web
                    Dev course) but also adjusted things by adding the Compose button at top and the All Posts section.
                    Using it to blog about my experiences learning to code.

                    like PathToCareer but with better styling (thanks to my lovely gradient picker app) and with a
                    time-imposed deadline trying to spend at least 1 hour a day working on projects/learning for the

                    but I had trouble getting it to cooperate at the moment. I kept running into a glitch where it turns
                    every past array element into a further array of characters. Time is limited tonight so I moved on
                    but hope to troubleshoot it further soon.

                    homework project from 100 Devs (eventually I will add a 100 Devs section). The project was to
                    recreate the JS in main without looking (which I did other than the missing quotes when using the
                    DOM to adjust the CSS). The second part of the assignment was to do something to make the project
                    your own, so I added a random color option and a random linear gradient option so that when I'm
                    struggling to pick colors for my projects I can play with this code until I find something I like.

                    Kit taking in click events and keydown events for buttons to play drum noises. I followed along with
                    the tutorial but did the lessons with minimal hints (got stuck realizing I needed to query the DOM
                    in order to apply the animation and had to find help for that part but the rest I was able to do
