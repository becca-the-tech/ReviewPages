    <h1>CSS Property Notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Opacity controls the transparency of the whole element, including any child elements</li>
        <li>rgba() is the alpha channel and if you set it for the background, it will just affect the transparency of
            the background not the whole element</li>
        <li>to add alpha channel to hex colors, add an extra two hex digits (so #a1a2a3 becomes #a1a2a300 for fully
            transparent, and #a1a2a3FF for fully opaque (although the FF is usually left off since that's the default
            setting)</li>
        <li>inline elements do not respect width, height, margin, or padding settings whereas block and inline-block
            elements will. They may sometimes appear with left-right padding/margins but they are inconsistent and so if
            you want to set those it should be "display: inline-block"</li>
        <li>If you have elements that aren't displaying their margin/width/height properly, check to see if they are
            inline elements and if so set them as inline-block</li>
        <li>body { margin: 0; } will get rid of that top and left margin that automatically comes with HTML pages</li>
        <li>justify-content in flex box needs a height specified explicitly first to work properly</li>
        <li>If imgs aren't aligning properly when side-by-side, check that the html has no line breaks between the imgs
            (put the start of one img tag on the same line as the end of the other) since HTML adds a space for the
            line-break between inline elements like spans or imgs which can throw off calculations (see photosite.html's
            images)</li>
    </ul>
