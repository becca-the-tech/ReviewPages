                    <li>mysteriousOrganism.js: An object of a strange organism that can have one of its bases mutated at
                        random and that has greater survivability when 'G' and 'C' bases are over 60%, so creates an
                        array of 30 creatures based upon their isLikelyToSurvive() method</li>
