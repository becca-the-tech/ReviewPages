    <h1>Notes on Functions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>"this" keyword</strong>
            The "this" keyword depends on invocation context (where it was called). So if you have an object with a
            method (car.drive()) but you save it to a new variable (let goToWork = car.drive() ) and car.drive uses the
            this keyword, it won't work when you call goToWork since functions declared have the window object as their
            parent instead of the initial object they were created off of.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>arr.filter()</strong><br>
            arr.filter(func) will create a new array after applying the function to each item in 'arr' and whichever
            items return true will be listed in the new array that is created... Ex: arr = [1,8,10,12,3]. arr.filter(num
            => { return num > 8}) would create a new array of [10,12] since those were the only that returned true.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>arr.some()</strong> and <strong>arr.every()</strong><br>
            arr.some(function) method checks that at least one item in an array returns true from the function passed
            in. arr.every(func) will check every item in an array to be sure all return true, otherwise it will reutrn
            false
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>arr.reduce()</strong><br>
            arr.reduce(function (accumulator, currentValue) { return accumultator + currentValue; } is used to keep
            track of a value and the current value and update it with each iteration through to a new current value. It
            doesn't have to be plus or minus, it can be any type of mathematical calculation being applied to each. You
            can also use it to find min or max. Ex: arr = [3,7,9,1,4] arr.reduce( (min, currentValue) => { if(min &lt;
            currentValue){ return min } else { return currentValue } } which would return 1.
        </li>
    </ul>
