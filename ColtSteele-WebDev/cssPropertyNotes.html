    <h1>CSS Property Notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Opacity controls the transparency of the whole element, including any child elements</li>
        <li>rgba() is the alpha channel and if you set it for the background, it will just affect the transparency of
            the background not the whole element</li>
        <li>to add alpha channel to hex colors, add an extra two hex digits (so #a1a2a3 becomes #a1a2a300 for fully
            transparent, and #a1a2a3FF for fully opaque (although the FF is usually left off since that's the default
            setting)</li>
        <li>inline elements do not respect width, height, margin, or padding settings whereas block and inline-block
            elements will. They may sometimes appear with left-right padding/margins but they are inconsistent and so if
            you want to set those it should be "display: inline-block"</li>
        <li>If you have elements that aren't displaying their margin/width/height properly, check to see if they are
            inline elements and if so set them as inline-block</li>
        <li>body { margin: 0; } will get rid of that top and left margin that automatically comes with HTML pages</li>
    </ul>
