    <h3>11/1/2020 Blog Post</h3>
    <p>I'm currently re-reading The Way Of Kings by Brandon Sanderson, enjoying his expansive world-building and
        detailed plots.
        I love how he has realistic characters discuss their emotions in detail, he doesn't try to hide the hard
        emotions
        his characters deal with, such as guilt over theft along with the urgency propelling the character,
        depression over seemingly stuck in a hopeless situation with the pain of losing others,
        and anger over injustices of treatment from the ruling classes.
