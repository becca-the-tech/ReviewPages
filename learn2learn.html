    <h1>Notes from Barbara Oakley's Course Learning How To Learn</h1>
    <h2>Diffuse versus Focused Mode</h2>
    <p>Diffuse mode is when you let your mind wander and it makes connections between different subjects. Focused mode
        is when you focus intensely on the things you are learning and to understand it.</p>

    <h2>Chunking</h2>
    <p>Chunking is learning in small sections and then using those parts to make connections to other lessons, linking
        lessons from diverse areas to see the big picture.</p>
