        <h3 id="rhythmOfWar">Rhythm of War</h3>
        <span>-By Brandon Sanderson, Book 4 of Stormlight Archive</span>
        <p>Rhythm of War follows the same cast of characters from prior books, this time dealing with Odium and his
            Fused singers battling with the humans over the Tower. Adolin and Shallan take a group to the honor spren
            capital to try to convince spren to bond with humans, but instead Adolin is put on trial for the guilt of
            previous humans in killing their spren. When the Fused take over the Tower, Kaladin has to deal with being
            one of the only Bridge 4 and Radiants left awake and being without his powers.</p>
        <h3 id="educated">Educated</h3>
        <span>-By Tara Westover</span>
        <p>This book is a non-fiction recount of Tara's life growing up, battling the frustrations of a family that
            doesn't believe in traditional school or government intervention, instead relying on the Bible as they
            prepare for the expected end of the world. Tara recounts all the ways her family challenged her education
            and how eventually she had to choose between family ties and pursuing her interests to make a name of
            herself and how difficult that choice was even when she could see her family's beliefs through clear eyes
            after so much time away.</p>
